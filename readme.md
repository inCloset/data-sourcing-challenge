Predicting Geomagnetic Storms (GSTs)
Code Source
The Module6 folder contains the source code for this project.
The source code file is named retrieve_data.ipynb.
Resources
A request call was made to the NASA API to fetch data on Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and Geomagnetic Storms (GSTs).
The data spans from 05/01/2013 to 05/01/2024.
These insights allow power grid operators and GPS system operators to receive early warnings, enabling them to make necessary adjustments.
Activities Conducted
The following analytical techniques were applied:

Data Fetching, Sourcing, Cleaning, Transforming, and Merging: Preparing the data for analysis.
Difference Analysis Between GST and CME: This helps predict the timing of the next Geomagnetic Storm.
